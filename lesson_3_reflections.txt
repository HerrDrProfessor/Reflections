When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository makes it easier to collaborate with other people. Having your project
on GitHub also works as a backup.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When the pulls are made manually, user has greater awareness of the git-structure. Sometimes the remote repository might have some
changes that you don't want to pull.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones or copied repositories on GitHub. Clones are copied repositories on local machines. Branches are structures of git commits. The
commits are ordered by the time they were made.
