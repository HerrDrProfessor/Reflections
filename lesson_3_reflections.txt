When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository makes it easier to collaborate with other people. Having your project
on GitHub also works as a backup.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When the pulls are made manually, user has greater awareness of the git-structure. Sometimes the remote repository might have some
changes that you don't want to pull.
