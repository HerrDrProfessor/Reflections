What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It makes it possible to later make git commits on that particular directory. You need to do it, if you want to make git commits.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

If I understood right, the staging area allows you to commit several files at once. Often files and changes are directly related,
so it can be useful to commit them together.
